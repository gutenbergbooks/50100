<div><img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_004.jpg" width="54" height="58" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-capi">From the remotest ages chemistry has exercised the
strongest fascination on the minds of the curious,
nor is it a matter of surprise that boys should feel
themselves drawn strongly by its mystery and
seeming magic. This attraction is undoubtedly caused by
what the ancients called the elements, earth, air, fire and
water. There is something so weird about the manifestation
of air and fire, that it is not difficult to understand
how the alchemists believed them to be forces able to be
used at the bidding of spirits, who might be conjured up
by incantations and spells.</p>

<p>Now it is known that these uncanny beings existed only
in the imagination of the forerunners of modern chemists.
Yet what boy can look on the brilliantly colored fires of a
Fourth of July display, or the burnished gold of the setting
sun, or the fantastic pictures in the glowing coals in
a grate, and not feel that there is still something of magic
and mystery in fire still? What the boy feels, the scientist
cannot explain. Nobody knows actually what fire is. All
that can be said is that fire is produced by certain substances,
such as coals, wood, or paper, <span id="TN_3">that</span> give out heat, while
passing from one state to another.</p>

<p>Now the word “element” was and is used to mean that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
simplest form of matter, which, with other simplest forms
goes to make up the whole world of everything in it. The
earth, animals, plants, the sea, the atmosphere, are all
made up of one or more of some seventy substances called
elements. Hence it is clear that the earth, air and water
are not, as the ancients thought, elements at all. As will
be seen in this little book, both air and water consist of
mixtures of elements. In chemistry such mixtures are
called compounds. This word occurs again and again, so
its explanation should be remembered.</p>

<p>One great fact must be remembered, which is at the very
root of chemistry. Nothing is really lost, however much
its form may be changed, or however many changes it may
pass through. For instance, it may seem that when a
block of wood be burned that a very large amount of it is
lost. If, however, the ashes, the smoke, and the carbon
that is burned by the air be all weighed, the result would
be exactly the same as the weight of the original block of
wood.</p>

<p>Again take an instance of a different nature. A lump of
sugar is placed in a small glass of water. Gradually the solid
is dissolved, and in time disappears. It is not lost, however.
By boiling the mixture until all the water has
evaporated the sugar will be found adhering as crystals on
the sides of the glass. If these be carefully collected, they
will be found to weigh precisely as much as the original
lump of sugar.</p>

<p>Once more, take a block of ice weighing an ounce. Having
removed it into a room, the solid will in an hour or two
have disappeared entirely, but the water that has replaced
the block of ice will weigh neither more nor less than an
ounce. If again heat be applied to the water it will all disappear,
but if weighed in a jam jar, the steam, although
invisible to the eye, will still weigh one ounce exactly.</p>

<p>From the above-given experiments it may be seen that,
however matter may change its form it cannot really be
destroyed. This truth will appear in every experiment that
can be performed, whether those given in this little book or
in the most learned treatise on chemistry.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chemical Affinity.</h2>


<p>This high-sounding term means that substances have a
power of uniting together that can be better explained by
an experiment. Allow a few drops of water to fall on a
perfectly clean piece of iron. In a short time a reddish-brown
substance will appear on the iron that in ordinary
language is called rust. What does this mean? Water is
a compound substance composed of oxygen and hydrogen,
but when brought into contact with iron the oxygen prefers
to unite with the iron and sets the hydrogen free.
Hence, would the chemist say, oxygen has a “stronger affinity”
for iron than for hydrogen. In this case the rust is
composed of rust, a combination of iron and oxygen called
oxide of iron. What has taken place may be shown by the
following, which will be easily understood:</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="displayinline">
Oxygen<br />
Hydrogen
</p>

<p class="displayinline" style="font-size:225%; vertical-align:12%;
margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:-1em;">}</p>

<p class="displayinline">
Water + Iron = Oxide<br />
of Iron + Hydrogen.
</p>
</div>

<p>So all that the chemical combination in the above means is
that the iron has taken the place of the hydrogen in the
water used for the experiment. If weighed it would be
found as always, that the water and the iron weighed precisely
the same as the oxide of iron and the hydrogen.</p>

<p>It is to this same principle of chemical affinity that the
curious experiments of magic writing with sympathetic
inks are possible.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Sympathetic Inks.</h2>


<p>By means of these may be carried on a correspondence
which is beyond the discovery of all not in the secret. With
one class of these inks the writing becomes visible only
when moistened with a particular solution. Thus, if we
write to you with a solution of sulphate of iron the letters
are invisible. On the receipt of our letter, you rub over the
sheet a feather or sponge, wet with a solution of nut-galls,
and the letters burst forth into sensible being at once, and
are permanent.</p>

<p>2. If we write with a solution of sugar of lead and you
moisten with a sponge or pencil dipped in water impregnated
with sulphuretted hydrogen, the letters will appear
with metallic brilliancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>3. If we write with a weak solution of sulphate of copper,
and you apply ammonia, the letters assume a beautiful
blue. When the ammonia evaporates as it does on exposure
to the sun or fire, the writing disappears, but may be
revived again as before.</p>

<p>4. If you write with oil of vitriol very much diluted, so
as to prevent its destroying the paper, the manuscript will
be invisible except when held to the fire, when the letters
will appear black.</p>

<p>5. Write with cobalt dissolved in diluted muriatic acid;
the letters will be invisible when cold, but when warmed
they will appear a bluish green.</p>

<p>Secrets thus written will not be brought to the knowledge
of a stranger, because he does not know the solution
which was used in writing, and therefore knows not what
to apply to bring out the letters.</p>

<p>Other forms of elective affinity produce equally novel results.
Thus, two invisible gases, when combined, form
sometimes a <em>visible solid</em>. Muriatic acid and ammonia are
examples, also ammonia and carbonic acid.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if a solution of sulphate of soda be
mixed with a solution of muriate of lime the whole becomes
solid.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some gases when united form liquids, as oxygen and hydrogen,
which unite and form water. Some solids when
combined form liquids.</p>

<p>Chemical affinity is sometimes called <em>elective</em>, or the effect
of <em>choice</em>, as if one substance exerted a kind of <em>preference</em>
for another, and <span id="TN_6">chose</span> to be united to it rather than
to that with which it was previously combined; thus, if you
pour some vinegar, which is a weak acetic acid, upon some
pearlash (a combination of potash and carbonic acid), or
some carbonate of soda (a combination of the same acid
with soda), a violent effervescence will take place, occasioned
by the escape of the carbonic acid, displaced in
consequence of the potash or soda preferring the acetic
acid, and forming a compound called an acetate.</p>

<p>Then, if some sulphuric acid be poured on this new compound,
the acetic acid will, in its turn, be displaced by the
greater attachment of either of the bases, as they are
termed, for the sulphuric acid. Again, if into a solution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of blue vitriol (a combination of sulphuric acid with copper),
the bright blade of a knife be introduced, the knife
will speedily be covered with a coat of copper, deposited
in consequence of the acid <em>preferring</em> the iron of which
the knife is made, a quantity of it being dissolved in exact
proportion to the quantity of copper deposited.</p>

<p>It is on the same principle that a very beautiful preparation
called a silver-tree, or a lead-tree, may be formed,
thus: Fill a wide bottle, capable of holding from half a
pint to a pint, with a tolerably strong solution of nitrate
of silver (lunar caustic), or acetate of lead, in pure distilled
water. Then attach a small piece of zinc by a string to the
cork or stopper of the bottle, so that the zinc shall hang
about the middle of the bottle, and set it by where it may
be quite undisturbed. In a short time brilliant plates of
silver or lead, as the case may be, will be seen to collect
around the piece of zinc, assuming more or less of the crystalline
form. This is a case of elective affinity; the acid
with which the silver or lead was united <em>prefers</em> the zinc
to either of those metals, and in consequence discards
them in order to attach the zinc to itself; and this process
will continue until the whole of the zinc is taken up, or the
whole of the silver or lead deposited.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Alum Baskets.</h2>


<p>Form a small basket about the size of the hand, of iron
wire or split willow; then take some cotton, such as ladies
use for running into flounces; untwist it and wind it
round every limb of the basket. Boil eighteen ounces of
alum in a quart of water, or quantities in that proportion;
stir the mixture while boiling until the alum is completely
dissolved. Pour the solution into a deep pan, or other convenient
vessel, and suspend the basket in the liquor, so
that no part of the basket shall touch the vessel, or be exposed
to the air. Let the whole remain perfectly at rest
for twenty-four hours. When you then remove the basket
the alum will be found very prettily crystallized over all
the limbs of the cottoned frame.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>




<h2>Easy Crystallizations.</h2>


<p>Saturate water <em>kept boiling</em> with alum; then set the
solution in a cool place, suspending in it, by a hair, or fine
silk thread, a cinder, a sprig of a plant, or any other trifle.
As the solution cools, a beautiful crystallization of the salt
takes place upon the cinders, etc., which are made to resemble
specimens of mineralogical spars.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>To Make a Piece of Charcoal Appear as Though it were Coated with Gold.</h2>


<p>Dilute a saturated solution of chloride of gold with five
times its bulk of water; place a thin strip of fresh burned
charcoal into it, and apply heat, gradually increasing it until
the solution gently boils. The heat will make the charcoal
precipitate the metal on the charcoal, in the form of
brilliant spangles.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>To Give a Piece of Charcoal a Rich Coat of Silver.</h2>


<p>Lay a crystal of nitrate of silver upon a piece of burning
charcoal; the metallic salt will catch fire, and throw out
the most beautiful scintillations that can be imagined.
The silver is reduced, and, in the end, produces upon the
charcoal a very brilliant appearance.</p>

<p>Many animal and vegetable substances, consist, for the
most part, of carbon, or charcoal, united with oxygen and
hydrogen, which remember, together combined, form
water. Now oil of vitriol or strong sulphuric acid, has so
powerful an affinity or so great a thirst for water, that it
will abstract it from almost any body in which it exists.
If you pour some of this acid on a lump of sugar, or place
a chip of wood in a small quantity of it, the sugar or wood
will become speedily blackened, that is charred, in consequence
of the oxygen and hydrogen being removed by the
sulphuric acid, and only the carbon or charcoal left.</p>

<p>When Cleopatra dissolved pearls of wondrous value in
vinegar, she was unwittingly giving an example of chemical
affinity. The pearl is simply carbonate of lime stored up
by the oyster in layers. Consequently the precious jewels
were decomposed by the greater affinity or fondness of lime
for the acetic acid in the vinegar, than for the carbonic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
acid with which it had been before united. This was an
example of inconstancy in strong contrast with the conduct
of their owner, who chose death rather than become
the wife of her lover’s conqueror.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Combustion.</h2>


<p>It is necessary to distinguish between burning and the
mere appearance of it. A gas flame is gas in a state of
combustion, whereas the electric light is no example of it,
although the wire within the glassen cylinder is red hot,
and to all appearance burning. Combustion generally
takes place through the strong affinity of some element,
such as carbon in a substance for the oxygen in the atmosphere.
In coal gas, for instance, the carbon contained in
it unites with the oxygen in the air to form a colorless substance
called carbonic acid gas. The latter is unable to
support life, and may be called, therefore, poisonous. It is
the presence of this gas which makes it unhealthy to burn
many jets without proper ventilation.</p>

<p>Also, carbonic acid gas is given off by the lungs. It may
seem curious, but it is none the less true, that breathing is
a process of combustion. The blood brings to the surface
of the lungs the carbon, which has resulted from the waste
of the internal organs of the body. When drawing in a
breath the oxygen present in the atmosphere meets the impure
blood at the surface of the lungs, and purifies it by
uniting with the carbon in it. Then, though oxygen has
been breathed in, carbonic acid gas has been breathed out.</p>

<p>To prove this will be interesting: Obtain from a chemist
a little lime water&mdash;two cents worth will do. It looks
like ordinary water, being perfectly transparent and colorless.
Pour some into a clean glass, and through a glass
tube blow steadily into the water. In half a minute the
hitherto colorless liquid will become milky and opaque.
If allowed to stand there will fall down at the bottom of
the glass a white powder.</p>

<p>What has happened in this case? The carbonic acid gas
from the lungs has formed with the lime in the lime water
a substance called carbonate of lime, which, being insoluble
in water, falls to the bottom of the glass as a white
powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>If carbonic acid gas were not present in the air blown
from the lungs, this milkiness would not appear, for no
other gas, except this, would alter the lime water’s clearness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Chemistry of The Air.</h2>


<p>Before proceeding further, it will be well to perform
one or two experiments, to prove that the air we breathe
is by no means the simple substance it is generally supposed
to be. Although it is invisible, it must be remembered
that it presses with a force of over fifteen pounds
to the square inch, over the whole surface of the earth.
It extends, too, to a height of some forty miles above the
earth, and though it cannot be seen, it can be felt in the
rush of the hurricane, and heard in the roar of the tempest.
It is chiefly composed of a mixture of two gases,
oxygen and nitrogen.</p>

<p>Did the air consist entirely of the former, people would
breathe too quickly, and die in a very short time in a high
fever, burned up, in fact. If only consisting of nitrogen,
the human race would also die, because this element is incapable
of supporting life; people would be suffocated, in
fact.</p>

<p>Therefore, a judicious mixture of the two is essential to
the life of animals. Generally, in a hundred parts of
air by weight there are seventy-six parts of nitrogen to
twenty-three of oxygen.</p>

<p>Besides these two gases, there is also a quantity of carbonic
acid gas in the air, given off by all the fires and animals
in the world. Of course, its amount is much greater
in the great towns and manufacturing centers than in
country districts.</p>

<p>Now herein must be recorded one of these charming arrangements
which Nature has designed for the benefit of
her children. Carbonic acid gas is much heavier than the
air, and, therefore, sinks towards the ground, where, if
allowed to accumulate, would cause the death of every animal.
Fortunately, however, plants breathe in through
their leaves carbonic acid gas during sunshine, and break
it up into carbon and oxygen. The former, they use for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
building up their trunks, leaves, and flowers, while during
the night they give off oxygen into the air.</p>

<p>This is the reason why plants and trees planted in the
streets so largely help to sweeten and purify the foul air
of a great city.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An experiment to prove that the atmosphere does consist
of nitrogen and oxygen, may be prettily proved in the
following simple manner: A glass marmalade jar, <span id="TN_11">or a
soup-plate</span> filled with water, and a piece of phosphorus
as large as a pea, are the only things necessary. Take
very great care not to touch the phosphorus, for the heat
of the hand is sufficient to set it on fire, and a terrible
wound would be caused.</p>

<p>Place the phosphorus in a match-box on the surface of
the water, touch it with a lighted match, and put the jar-mouth
downwards over it to the bottom of the plate. The
phosphorus burns with a dazzling brilliancy, and gives off
dense white fumes. At the same time the water rises a
third of the way up the jar, but not to the top, thus showing
that all the invisible matter has not been consumed.
The white soon settles into the water and is dissolved.
The phosphorus has combined with the oxygen in the jar
and forms phosphoric oxide, which dissolves in water.
There is then only the nitrogen left. The disappearance
of the oxygen allows the water to fill up the space it formerly
occupied.</p>

<p>This may be followed by another experiment.</p>

<p>To show that oxygen is necessary for the support of
combustion, fix two or three pieces of wax taper on flat
pieces of cork, and set them floating on water in a soup-plate,
light them, and invert over them a glass jar.</p>

<p>As they burn, the heat produced may perhaps at first expand
the air, so as to force a small quantity out of the jar,
but the water will soon rise in the jar, and continue to do
so until the tapers expire, when you will find that a considerable
portion of the air has disappeared, and what remains
will no longer support flame.</p>

<p>The oxygen has been converted partly into water, and
partly into carbonic acid gas, by uniting with the carbon
and hydrogen of which the taper consists, and the remaining
air is principally nitrogen, with some carbonic acid.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
The presence of the latter may be proved by decanting
some of the remaining air into a bottle, and then shaking
some lime water with it, which will absorb the carbonic
acid and form chalk.</p>

<p>Into an ale glass, two thirds full of water at about 140 degrees,
drop one or two pieces of phosphorus about the size
of peas, and they will remain unaltered. Then take a
bladder containing oxygen gas, to which is attached a stop
cock and a long fine tube. Pass the end of the tube to the
bottom of the water, turn the stop cock, and press the
bladder gently. As the gas reaches the phosphorus it
will take fire, and burn under the water with a brilliant
flame, filling the glass with brilliant flashes of light dashing
through the water.</p>

<p>Into another glass put some cold water; introduce carefully
some of the salt called chlorate of potash; upon that
drop a piece of phosphorus; then let some strong sulphuric
acid (oil of vitriol) trickle slowly down the side of the
glass, or introduce it by means of a dropping bottle.</p>

<p>As soon as the acid touches the salt the latter is decomposed,
and liberates a gas which ignites the phosphorus,
producing much the same appearance as in the last experiment.</p>

<p>Into the half of a broken phial put some chlorate of potash,
and pour in some oil of vitriol. The phial will soon
be filled with a heavy gas of a deep yellow color. Tie a
small test tube at right angles to the end of a stick not less
than a yard long, put a little ether into the tube, and pour
it gently into the phial of gas, when an instantaneous explosion
will take place, and the ether will be set on fire.
This experiment should be performed in a place where
there are no articles of furniture to be damaged, as the ingredients
are often scattered by the explosion, and the oil
of vitriol destroys all animal and vegetable substances.</p>

<p>Into a jar containing oxygen gas introduce a coil of soft
iron wire, suspended to a cork that fits the neck of the jar
and having attached a small piece of charcoal to the lower
part of the wire, ignite the charcoal. The iron will take
fire and burn with a brilliant light, throwing out bright
scintillations, which are oxide of iron, formed by the union
of the gas with the iron; and they are so intensely hot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that some of them will probably <em>melt</em> their way into the
sides of the jar, if not through them.</p>

<p>But by far the most intense heat, and most brilliant light,
may be produced by introducing a piece of phosphorus into
a jar of oxygen. The phosphorus may be placed in a small
copper cup, with a long handle of thick wire passing
through a hole in a cork that fits the jar. The phosphorus
must first be ignited; and as soon as it is introduced into
the oxygen, it gives out a light so brilliant that no eye
can bear it, and the whole jar appears filled with an intensely
luminous atmosphere. It is well to dilute the
oxygen with about one-fourth part of common air, to moderate
the intense heat, which is nearly certain to break the
jar if pure oxygen is used.</p>

<p>The following experiment shows the production of heat
by chemical action alone: Bruise some fresh-prepared
crystals of nitrate of copper, spread them over a piece of
tin foil, sprinkle them with a little water; then fold up the
foil tightly, as rapidly as possible, and in a minute or two
it will become red hot, the tin apparently burning away.
This heat is produced by the energetic action of the tin on
the nitrate of copper, taking away its oxygen in order to
unite with the nitric acid, for which, as well as for the oxygen
the tin has a much greater affinity than the copper has.</p>

<p>Combustion without flame may be shown in a very
elegant and agreeable manner, by taking a coil of platinum
wire and twisting it round the stem of a tobacco pipe, or
any cylindrical body for a dozen times or so, leaving about
an inch straight, which should be inserted into the wick
of a spirit lamp. Light the lamp, and after it has burned
for a minute or two, extinguish the flame quickly; the
wire will soon become red hot, and, if kept from draughts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of air, will continue to burn until all the spirit is consumed.</p>

<p>Spongy platinum, as it is called, answers rather better
than wire, and has been employed in the formation of
fumigators for the drawing-room, in which, instead of
pure spirit, some perfume, such as lavender water, is used;
by its combustion an agreeable odor is diffused through
the apartment. These little lamps were much in vogue a
few years ago, but are now nearly out of fashion. Finally,
all the readers of this little book should be very careful in
performing all experiments. If possible, he should use a
room with a stone floor and no curtains, while an outhouse
with an earthen floor is still less dangerous.</p>

<h2>Amateur Air Pump.</h2>


<p>A most interesting class of experiments can be made
with an air pump, a piece of apparatus unfortunately beyond
the pocket-money supply of the average boy. Nevertheless,
if the following instructions are exactly followed
and carefully carried out, a very excellent air pump can be
made at a comparatively small cost. Some pretty, as well
as interesting results will amply repay you for the trouble
you take to make the pump. Although the air seems so
light in comparison with water or a heavy metal like iron,
you must remember that it really presses upon every
square inch of the earth’s surface, aye, on every square
inch of your own bodies, with a force of fourteen and a
half pounds. In other words, the weight of the air at the
sea level resting on each square inch of surface weighs
fourteen and a half pounds.</p>

<p>Don’t be frightened, boys, at the explanation of one word
that must be used in connection with air experiments. The
word is vacuum. Vacuum really means an empty space,
devoid of all matter, even of air. Although it seems easy
to think of an empty space, it is quite impossible to exhaust
a space of all matter, even of air. For this reason,
the alchemists of the middle ages used to say: “Nature abhors
a vacuum.” This was only their way of saying how
impossible it was to make a space, such as the inside of a
vessel, quite empty. Yet it is possible to reduce the
amount of air in a vessel almost to nothing.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Now for the pump. In the first place obtain three pieces
of gutta-percha tubing of the following lengths:</p>

<p>No. 1.&mdash;A tube twelve and a half inches long, measuring
outside two and a half, inside one and a half inches in circumference.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;This must be seven and a half inches long, one
and a half inches outside, and an inch inside.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;This is a length of tubing about sixty inches long,
two and a half inches in outside circumference, and at
least an inch thick. If an inch and a half thick all the
better, as it will be more air-tight.</p>

<p>Divide tube No. 2 into two equal parts, cutting from right
to left at an angle of 45 degrees. Into one of the parts fit
a plug of hard wood pierced lengthwise by a red hot wire
(fig. 1); the figure shows the shape of it sufficiently. In
the hollow side cut a small opening, and over this tie very
tightly a band of flexible india-rubber (fig. 3). This band
will serve as the valve of the piston of the pump. Figs. 3
and 4 give a side and front view of this valve. Great care
must be taken neither to split the plug in boring the hole
nor to cut the tube.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="displayinline figcenter" style="width: 180px;">
<img src="images/i_017a.jpg" width="180" height="126" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></p></div>
</div>

<div id="Fig_4" class="displayinline figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_017b.jpg" width="300" height="153" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></p></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This valve must now be inserted in the large tube No. 1,
as seen in fig. 2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>At the other end of the large tube, which will serve as
the body of the pump, at B fig. 2, fix a similar valve to the
above, but the india-rubber band must be fixed on the other
side of the valve as at B fig. 2. The fitting A will serve
for escape, the second for withdrawing the air from the
space to be exhausted. Finally fix tube No. 3 on valves A
or B, fig. 2, according to your wish to produce a vacuum or
to compress the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="600" height="461" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>By means of a pedal made simply with two boards put
together on hinges (fig. 5), one pressed with the foot, the
air contained in the body of the pump (fig. 2) tends to escape.
It therefore lifts the valve of the fitting fixed at A,
and escapes through the flexible elastic band tied over the
hole in the hollow side of tube No. 2. If the pressure
ceases the big tube, on account of its own elasticity, takes
its former form and sucks in the air. This time it is the
valve at B which is lifted and lets pass the air which fills
the body of the pump. If one has fixed on to the fitting at
B, the long india-rubber tube No. 3, which is plunged in a
receiver&mdash;a receiver is any vessel in which the air is exhausted,
or into which it is forced&mdash;it is easily understood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that after a few moves of the pedal, the air is drawn out,
and a vacuum is obtained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="300" height="639" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>If one wishes to have a force-pump one has only to modify
slightly the construction of the valve. Instead of a
band of india-rubber fixed as shown in fig. 3, it is<span id="TN_18a"> altered
as in fig. 4</span>, that is to say the valve is formed by a band of
supple india-rubber fastened by two tacks only on one side
of the opening in the side of the plug. For this object it is
also necessary to take stronger tubes.</p>

<p>Let us now review the few experiments that can be made
with this machine.</p>

<p>In order to conduct experiments a receiver must be obtained.
The best vessel for your purpose is a large bell-jar
with a ground glass stopper and neck to insure absolute <span id="TN_18b">tightness</span>.
Such a jar may be cheaply obtained at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
scientific instrument maker’s for about seventy-five cents.
If you cannot get a bell-jar procure a 4-lb. jam pot and a
tightly-fitting bung. In the middle of the latter bore a hole
to admit a glass tube, some six inches long and an inch in
diameter, and then sealing-wax the whole of the upper surface
of the bung so that air cannot enter. Over the projecting
end of the glass tube, bind very tightly the free
end of the long tubing affixed to the pump. To ensure
tight binding, waxed thread should be used.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Asphyxia.</h2>


<p>Put a mouse&mdash;it is necessary to catch him first&mdash;into the
receiver, and work the pump. Soon the animal will show
all the signs of being choked, and eventually will die. This
is proof sufficient that animals cannot live without air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_020.jpg" width="400" height="484" alt="" />
</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Balloon in Vacuum.</h2>


<p>Place in the receiver a small bladder, such as are sold in
the streets for a few cents. Wet it a little to make it more
supple. Now, in the ordinary way the air inside the bladder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
exerts the same pressure on the skin of the bladder as
does the air on the outside. Now work the pedal so that
the air in the receiver is gradually exhausted. The bladder
will be seen to gradually swell and finally burst. It bursts
because as the air in the receiver is exhausted by the pump,
the air outside the bladder exerts a less force than the air
inside. But the air inside is confined by the bladder skin,
a not very strong material, as you know, so as soon as the
difference between the inside and outside pressures is
greater than the strength of the bladder, the latter bursts.
This experiment also shows the expansible power of air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="400" height="514" alt="" />
</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Boiling Cold Water.</h2>


<p>Place in the receiver a tumbler of cold water and work
the pump as before. In a few minutes, as soon as the air is
sufficiently exhausted, the water will apparently boil. Yet
you know the water does not boil in a kettle unless heated
to 212 degrees. This phenomenon is thus explained: The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
vacuum causes the air-bubbles contained in the water to
escape. They easily do so, because there is scarcely any reserve
on the surface of the liquid (see fig.).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="400" height="466" alt="" />
</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A Sucking Tube.</h2>


<p>This force, the pressure of the air which you have just
ascertained, supplies various experiments in its illustration.</p>

<p>Take a tin tube, for example, the tin holder of a penny
pen, which you may procure at any stationer’s. Put a little
water in it and make it boil so that the steam takes the
place of the air.</p>

<p>When steaming furiously stop the mouth of the tube
with a small cork, sealing the opening hermetically. Oil
it a little, so it may glide with ease. If you cool the tube
by plunging it in a basin of cold water, for example, the
steam is condensed, forming a vacuum in the interior, and
under the atmospheric pressure the cork will glide down.
Fasten a string to the cork and you can withdraw it and
begin the operation again. As the water gets hot, steam is
reformed; you will see the cork come up again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>A capital way of making this cork is to stick the tube in
a piece of potato, cutting out of the latter a perfectly-fitting
cork.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 296px;">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="296" height="650" alt="" />
</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Cupping.</h2>


<p>Instead of a jar-receiver, take a long-necked bottle open
at both ends. If you place the hand on one of the open
ends and exhaust the air, by attaching the long tube of the
pump to the other you cannot remove the hand easily. Do
not try to pump the air out <span id="TN_22">entirely, as</span> the suction may
be too strong and draw blood. It is by the rarefaction of
the air that the cupping-glass is applied to people who require
bleeding. In the antiquated surgical operation of
cupping, the doctor burned a few pieces of paper in small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
glass cups, which are then applied to the skin; the air, in
getting cold, contracted and produced a partial vacuum,
thus acting as the bottle did in the above experiment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>The Barometer.</h2>


<p>Now you shall learn something about the pressure exercised
by the atmospheric layer which surrounds the
earth to the height of about forty miles. This is done
with the aid of a very well-known instrument called the
barometer.</p>

<p>You may construct one yourselves. Procure a glass tube
closed at one end, about a yard long and one tenth of an
inch in diameter. Fill it with mercury, then turn it upside
down into a bowl filled with the same metal, taking care
that the air does not enter the tube. The column will stop
at a height between 29 and 30 inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>This, therefore is the measure of the force of the air’s
pressure, for in the upper part of the tube there is an absolute
vacuum and nothing would prevent the mercury from
going higher up. The weight of the air layer corresponds,
therefore, to a height of nearly 30 inches of mercury.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 161px;">
<img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="161" height="650" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This weight has been before stated, viz., fourteen and a
half pounds, such a weight being supported by every single
square inch of the globe’s surface. A marvelous pressure
is thus exerted on the whole earth. In other words, the
weight of the air that surrounds the earth on all sides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
is no less than the following enormous number of 5,184,740,000,000,000
tons.</p>

<p>A man of average height, himself supports the enormous
pressure of 34,171 pounds, or over 15 tons, and yet does not
feel the least inconvenience in his movements. It is because
this pressure is exercised in all directions, and a human
body carries within it elastic fluids that counterbalance
that tremendous weight.</p>

<p>So accustomed do people become to this weight that
when the weather is stormy, a feeling of heaviness comes
on.</p>

<p>However, it is just the contrary which takes place when
the barometer is lower; that is to say, the atmospheric pressure
has diminished. Consequently there is less weight to
be carried.</p>

<p>You would experience the same sensation when going
up in a balloon. As you rise higher and higher the weight
of the air is less felt, and this makes people so uncomfortable
that at a height of about 9,000 or 10,000 yards the liquids
in our body&mdash;the blood, the water, the bile&mdash;tend to escape
outwards. Why? Because they are no longer balanced by
an outside pressure equal in force to them. In fact, if you
continued to ascend, your fate would be that of the bladder
in the first experiment&mdash;you would burst. Thus are you
and all creatures attached to the face of the earth, and it
seems as if great heights were forbidden to our curiosity.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A Novel Barometer.</h2>


<p>Construct a toy house of cardboard, painted, and let
there be two open doorways in the front, and let it stand
on a wooden platform to represent the ground. The two
sides and back may come right down to the ground, but
there must be a slight space between the front of the house
and the ground upon which it stands.</p>

<p>Next make a flat wheel or disc of wood about the thickness
of a penny, its diameter or measurement across the
center to measure the same as the distance between the two
doorways of the house. The wheel disc or turn-table must
have a shaft or spindle in the middle, so that it will revolve
easily in a hole made for it in the floor or ground which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
your cardboard house stands on; this pivot-hole should be
just within the house and exactly half way between the
two doors.</p>

<p>In the next place get two small dolls of such size that
they will pass easily through the doorways, or you may
cut them out of cork or some light substance. Dress one
to represent an old man and the other as his wife, and fix
them opposite each other at the edge of the disc or wheel
in such a manner, that when it turns on its axle, the figures
move in and out of the two doorways provided for
their accommodation, for it appears that, although residing
in the same house, they are not on very good terms. When
the husband goes out the wife remains at home, and as she
only ventures abroad in fine weather, her spouse is obliged
to look out when rain may be expected.</p>

<p>The motive power has now to be provided and this takes
the form of a piece of catgut, such as violin strings are
made of; this is a substance very susceptible of atmospheric
influences, for dry weather contracts or tightens it, while
a damp atmosphere causes it to relax. Double your catgut
and twist it, fasten one end of the rope so formed near the
back of the house inside and fasten the other to the pivot
or axle, with two or three turns round it. As the weather
changes the tightening or relaxing of the rope will cause
the figures to move in and out of the house. Of course, the
figures must be arranged so that the lady comes out when
the rope is tightened by the dryness of the atmosphere.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Compressed Air.</h2>


<p>To make experiments with compressed air, you must put
your wits together to make a reservoir. Air, you know, is
a gas consisting of particles called atoms. These atoms
are at a certain distance from one another. They can be
pushed further from one another as when you heat them,
or closer together by cold and compression. So compressed
air only means air whose atoms are pressed more closely together
than as the case with the air around us.</p>

<p>Now you have heard that a column of air on a square inch
weighs fourteen and a half pounds. Also, you know that
air in a receiver or any other vessel presses on the vessel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
inside and out with a force (or weight) of fourteen and a
half pounds.</p>

<p>If now into the vessel you push another quantity of air,
equal to the vessel’s capacity, you simply push the atoms
of air closer together. In fact, they are now only half as far
apart as the atoms of an open vessel. But the pressure is
doubled and the compressed air, therefore, will press on the
inside of the vessel with a force of twenty-nine pounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="600" height="320" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Now to make the reservoir. Get a tin tube about 40<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
inches long and four in diameter, closed at both ends.
Take care that the soldering is well done. Two openings
must be made, and a small tube inserted in each. To each
of these attach an indiarubber tube, one four feet long, and
the other six. (See fig.).</p>

<p>To fill this reservoir with compressed air, apply the air-pump
fitted with the <span id="TN_28">valve shown in <a href="#Fig_4">fig. 4</a></span>, in the description
of an air-pump. Squeeze tightly the upper tube of the
reservoir before beginning to pump, and then it will
be easy to judge the amount of compression of the air. For
the first experiment place a light ball or sheet of paper over
the mouth of the tube, and loosen your hold on it. The object
will immediately be blown away with considerable
force.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Noiseless Bell.</h2>


<p>We know that sound is a succession of vibrations which
must be transmitted in a medium with weight, as air or
water; in other words, in a vacuum there can be no sound
at all. To prove this, introduce into the receiver a small
bell, and as the air is extracted the sounds become weaker<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and weaker, and cease altogether when the air is completely
rarified.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="400" height="464" alt="" />
</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>The Bursting Bladder.</h2>


<p>Tie a thin piece of light indiarubber round the top of the
bottle, and you will notice that as the air is withdrawn,
the indiarubber will stretch, and at length form a round
small balloon in the interior of the bottle. (Fig. 1).</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="figcenter displayinline" style="width: 240px;">
<img src="images/i_030a.jpg" width="240" height="576" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></p></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter displayinline" style="width: 240px;">
<img src="images/i_030b.jpg" width="240" height="526" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></p></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If a piece of bladder is tightly stretched and tied round
the vessel (fig. 2.) it will burst under the force of the atmospheric
pressure which acts upon it, through a vacuum having
been made underneath. This is another case of the
first experiment with the air pump described above.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Weight of the Air.</h2>


<p>Another experiment will still better make you appreciate
the value of this factor: the weight of the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Put a piece of supple leather in which a ring is attached
under the bottle; pump the air out of the latter and you
will be astonished at the weight you may hang on this
leather without dragging it off.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="600" height="522" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Should you not have at hand a glass receiver, a wooden
reel may serve instead (see fig.). On one of its faces place
a piece of strong cardboard, in the middle of which a hook
has been fastened; when the rarefaction is made, rather
heavy weights must be hooked on before the cardboard is
detached from the face of the rest.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Spoons which will Melt in Hot Water.</h2>


<p>Fuse together in a crucible, eight parts of bismuth, five
of lead and three of tin; these metals will combine and
form an alloy, of which spoons may be made, possessed of
the remarkable property of melting in boiled water.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Effect of Compression.</h2>


<p>Take a wooden reel and hollow out either the top or bottom,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
beginning at the hole in the center and working towards
the edge. In the hollow place a ball. Apply to the
other end the indiarubber tube which conducts the forced
air, and the ball will be lifted up (see fig.).</p>

<h2>To Cover Iron with Copper.</h2>


<p>If you are about to perform a conjuring trick, you will,
of course take great care that your apparatus is ready.
Therefore, clean your piece of iron or steel from dirt. Dip
a piece of polished iron&mdash;the blade of your knife, for instance&mdash;into
a solution, either of nitrate or sulphate of copper,
when it will assume the appearance of a piece of pure
copper.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>The Elements.</h2>


<p>Before entering into the next series of experiments the
young chemist must know that all the substances of which
the world and everything in it are made up&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, the elements
are arranged in two classes, the metals and the non-metals.
The former are by far the more numerous, altogether
numbering more than fifty. Among the better
known are such well known substances as iron, mercury,
copper, tin, potassium, antimony, strontium, and nickel.
The non-metals are more widely distributed and together
made up of the bulk of the universe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>They comprise the gases&mdash;oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen,
and chlorine, and such substances as sulphur, carbon, phosphorus
and iodine. To the latter class also belongs a peculiar
element called fluorine, which, when combined with
hydrogen, destroys glass. It is the only liquid known
which cannot be contained in a glassen or earthenware
vessel, and when used for experimental purposes must be
kept in a leaden bottle.</p>

<p>Of course it will be understood that the above is not a
complete list by any means, but is sufficient to give a clear
idea of the difference between the two classes. The metals
generally speaking are of a more or less sparkling, lustrous
appearance. The metals, too, are good conductors of
heat and electricity, and generally heavy. These characteristics
are almost entirely wanting in the non-metals.
We shall now give some tricks with the metals.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Potassium.</h2>


<p>Potassium was discovered by Sir H. Davy, in the beginning
of the present century, while acting upon potash with
the enormous galvanic battery of the Royal Institution,
consisting of two thousand pairs of four inch plates. It is
a brilliant metal, so soft as to be easily cut with a penknife,
and so light as to swim upon water, on which it acts
with great energy, uniting with the oxygen and liberating
the hydrogen, which takes fire as it escapes.</p>

<p>Trace some continuous lines on paper with a camel’s-hair
brush dipped in water, and place a piece of potassium about
the size of a pea on one of the lines, and it will follow the
course of the pencil, taking fire as it runs, and burning
with a purplish light.</p>

<p>The paper will be found covered with a solution of ordinary
potash. If turmeric paper be used, the course of the
potassium will be marked with a deep brown color. Hence
if you touch potassium with wet fingers you will burn
them.</p>

<p>If a small piece of the metal be placed on a piece of ice,
it will instantly take fire, and form a deep hole which will
be found to contain a solution of potash.</p>

<p>In consequence of its great affinity for oxygen, potassium
must be kept in some fluid destitute of it, such as naphtha<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
acid, which has been displaced by the great affinity or
liking of the oxygen and acid for the copper.</p>

<p>2. When the copper is no longer coated, but remains
clean and bright when immersed in the fluid, all the silver
has been deposited, and the glass now contains a solution
of copper.</p>

<p>Nearly all the colors used in the arts are produced by
metals and their combinations; indeed, one is named
chromium, from a Greek word signifying color, on account
of the beautiful tints obtained from its various combinations
with oxygen and the other metals. All the various
tints, of green, orange, yellow and red are obtained from
this metal.</p>

<p>Solutions of most of the metallic salts give precipitates
with solutions of alkalies and their salts, as well as with
many other substances, such as what are usually called
prussiate of potash, hydrosulphret of ammonia, etc. The
colors differ according to the metal employed; and so small
a quantity is required to produce the color, that the solutions
before mixing may be nearly colorless.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Metallic Colors.</h2>


<p>To a solution of sulphate of iron add a drop or two of a
solution of prussiate of potash, and a blue color will be produced.</p>

<p>2. Substitute sulphate of copper for iron, and the color
will be a rich brown.</p>

<p>3. Another blue, of quite a different tint, may be produced
by letting a few drops of a solution of ammonia fall into
one of sulphate of copper, when a precipitate of a light
blue falls down, which is dissolved by an additional quantity
of the ammonia, and forms a transparent solution of
the most splendid rich blue color.</p>

<p>4. Into a solution of sulphate of iron, drop a few drops of
strong infusion of galls, and the color will become a bluish
black&mdash;in fact ink. A little tea will answer as well as the
infusion of galls. This is the reason why certain stuffs
formerly in general use for dressing-gowns for gentlemen
were so objectionable; for as they were indebted to a salt
of iron for their color, buff as it was called, a drop of tea
accidentally spilled produced all the effect of a drop of ink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Put into a largish test tube two or three small pieces
of granulated zinc, fill it about one-third full of water, put
in a few grains of iodine, and boil the water, which will at
first acquire a dark purple color, gradually fading as the
iodine combines with the zinc. Add a little more iodine
from time to time, until the zinc is nearly all dissolved.
If a few drops of this solution be added to an equally colorless
solution of corrosive sublimate (a salt of mercury), a
precipitate will take place of a splendid scarlet color,
brighter, if possible, than vermilion, which is also a preparation
of mercury.</p>

<h2>Crystallization of Metals.</h2>


<p>Some of the metals assume certain definite forms in return
from the fluid to the solid state. Bismuth shows this
property more readily than most others.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Melt a pound or two of bismuth in an iron ladle over the
fire; remove it as soon as the whole is fluid; and when the
surface has become solid break a hole in it and pour out
the still fluid metal from the interior; what remains will
exhibit beautifully formed crystals of a cubic shape.</p>

<p>Sulphur may be crystallized in the same manner, but its
fumes, when heated, are so very unpleasant that few would
wish to encounter them.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable facts in chemistry&mdash;a science
abounding in wonders&mdash;is the circumstance that the mere
contact of hydrogen, the lightest body known, with the
metal platinum, the heaviest when in a state of minute division
called spongy platinum, produces an intense heat
sufficient to inflame the hydrogen; of course this experiment
must be made in the presence of atmospheric air or
oxygen. If a small piece of the metal in the state above
named be introduced into a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen,
it will cause them to explode. A very small quantity
of gas should be employed and placed in a jar lightly covered
with a card, or the explosion would be dangerous.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Crystallization.</h2>


<p>Nearly all the metals are characterized by the crystals,
which are formed as they pass from a state of intense heat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to that of comparative coldness. It is by this process they
have been formed when in the mine or vein in the rocks.
The earth was once a fiery mass of molten matter, as seen
even now when a volcano is in a state of eruption. And it
was only by the cooling of the outside shell of the earth, or
crust, as it is called, that it became habitable.</p>

<p>When the crust was cooling down the metals crystallized
among the cooling rocks and gradually formed the crude
arts. You may represent by a very pretty experiment the
manner in which this cooling off of the earth took place.
Obtain a little flour of sulphur and put it in a red earthenware
unglazed jar. Thrust it well into the fire and watch
the rust. As soon as the heat has penetrated the vessel
the yellow powdery sulphur becomes first of all brown,
and then assumes the consistency of thick birdlime. Take
out a little of this on the end of a stick and plunge it into
cold water. It can then be pulled backwards and forwards
like cobblers’ wax. This well represents the state of the
half-cooled crust of the earth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sulphur on the fire begins to boil, and
looks very much like bubbling treacle. Remove it from
the fire and allow it to cool. When quite cool the surface
will be a flat, yellow mass, like ordinary roll sulphur,
which, when ground, give the ordinary flour of sulphur.</p>

<p>With a sharp knife separate the mass from the vessel
and look at the under-surface. There it will be found to
have assumed a very different form, owing to the exclusion
of the air, and consequent slower cooling. Large six-sided
crystals, transparent, and of a most exquisitely delicate
yellow, will be seen, piled on one another as appear
the masses of ore in rocks.</p>

<p>Nature always works in such cases on such a gigantic
scale that it seems at first difficult to believe that such huge
piles as the Giant’s Causeway in Ireland, or Fingals in
Scotland, or the lodes of tin ore in Cornwall, worked by
the Phœnicians three thousand years ago, and still being
worked, were all formed by the same process.</p>

<p>The time that the earth must have taken to cool fairly
staggers the imagination, yet it is only from guessing, by
means of such a study as this, that geologists are able to
form any idea of how long ago it was that the earth’s crust<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
became cool enough to allow animal and plant life to exist
upon it.</p>

<p>The most beautiful crystalline form is perhaps the diamond,
and yet this precious gem is but the same thing,
chemically, as charcoal. Charcoal is pure carbon in the
uncrystallized state, which the magic of crystallization
has transformed into the symbol of all that is brilliant and
beautiful.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Beauties of Crystallization.</h2>


<p>Dissolve alum in hot water until no more can be dissolved
in it; place in it a smooth glass rod and a stick of
the same size. Next day the stick will be found covered
with crystals, but the glass rod will be free from them.
In this case the crystals cling to the rough surface of the
stick, but have no hold upon the smooth surface of the glass
rod.</p>

<p>But if the rod be roughened with a file at certain intervals,
and then placed in the alum and water, the crystals
will adhere to the rough surfaces, and leave the smooth
bright and clear.</p>

<p>Tie some threads of lamp-cotton irregularly around a
copper wire or glass rod. Place it in a hot solution of blue
vitriol, strong as above, and the threads will be covered
with beautiful blue crystals, while the glass rod will be
bare.</p>

<p>Bore a hole through a piece of coke, and suspend it by a
string from a stick placed across a hot solution of alum.
It will float. But as it becomes loaded with crystals it will
sink in the solution according to the length of the string.
Gas-coke has mostly a smooth, shining, and almost metallic
surface, which the crystals will avoid, while they will
cling only to the most irregular and porous parts.</p>

<p>If powdered turmeric be added to the hot solution of alum
the crystals will be of a bright yellow. Litmus will cause
them to be of a bright red. Logwood will yield purple;
and common writing ink, black. And the more muddy
the solution the finer will be the crystals.</p>

<p>To keep colored alum crystals from breaking or losing
their color, place them under a glass shade with a saucer
of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>This will preserve the atmosphere moist, and prevent the
crystals getting too dry.</p>

<p>If crystals be formed on wire they will be liable to break
off, from the expansion and contraction of the wire by
changes of temperature.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>To Crystallize Camphor.</h2>


<p>Dissolve camphor in spirit of wine, moderately heated,
until the spirit will not dissolve any more; pour some of
the solution into a cold glass, and the camphor will instantly
crystallize in beautiful tree-like forms, such as we
see in the show-glasses of camphor in druggists’ windows.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Another Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Heat some blue vitriol (sulphate of copper) in an iron
ladle till all the water contained in the crystals is driven
off, and the color changes to a gray. Take the lumps out
without breaking them, and lay the dried blue vitriol on a
plate. If this be moistened with water steam is produced;
and if a slice of phosphorus is then laid on the sulphate of
copper it ignites, demonstrating again that the condensation
of a liquid produces heat. The addition of the water
restores the blue color, thus proving that water was necessary
to the composition of blue vitriol.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A Solid Changed to a Liquid.</h2>


<p>Mix five parts by weight of powdered sal ammoniac, five
parts of nitre in powder, and sixteen parts of water. A
temperature of twenty-two degrees below the freezing
point of water is produced; and if a phial of water, or any
convenient metallic cylinder containing water, be surrounded
with a sufficient quantity of the freezing mixture,
ice is formed. The ice clings to the interior of the tube,
but may easily be removed by dipping it in tepid water.</p>

<p>This experiment is the reverse of the last and proves that
the sudden reduction of a solid to the liquid condition always
affords cold.</p>

<p>An amusing combination of two experiments may be
made by putting some fresh-burned lime into one tea pot
and this freezing mixture into another. When water is
poured on the one containing lime, it gives out steam<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
from the spout, while the addition of water to the other
produces so much cold that it can hardly be kept in the
hand. Thus heat and cold are afforded through the same
medium, water.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Magic of Heat.</h2>


<p>Melt a small quantity of the sulphate of potash and copper
in a spoon over a spirit lamp. It will be fused at a heat
just below redness, and produce a liquid of a dark-green
color. Remove the spoon from the flame, when the liquid
will become a solid of a brilliant emerald green color, and
so remain until its heat sinks nearly to that of boiling
water, when suddenly a commotion will take place
throughout the mass, beginning from the surface, and each
atom, as if animated, will start up and separate itself from
the rest, till in a few moments the whole will become a
heap of powder.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Sublimation by Heat.</h2>


<p>Provide two small pieces of glass; sprinkle a minute
portion of sulphur upon one piece, lay thin slips of wood
around it, and place upon it the other piece of glass.
Move them slowly over the flame of a lamp or candle, and
the sulphur will become sublimed, and form gray, nebulous
patches, which are very curious microscopic objects.
Each cluster consists of thousands of transparent globules,
imitating in miniature the nebulæ which we see figured in
treatises on astronomy. By observing the largest particles
we shall find them to be flattened on one side. Being very
transparent, each of them acts the part of a little lens, and
forms in its focus the image of a distant light, which can
be perceived even in the smaller globules, until it vanishes
from minuteness. If they are examined again after a certain
number of hours, the smaller globules will generally
be found to have retained their transparency, while the
larger ones will have become opaque, in consequence of the
sulphur having undergone some internal spontaneous
change. But the most remarkable circumstance attending
this experiment is that the globules are found adhering to
the upper glass only; the reason of which is that the upper
glass is somewhat cooler than the lower one, by which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
means we see that the vapor of sulphur is very powerfully
repelled by heated glass. The flattened form of the particles
is owing to the force with which they endeavor to recede
from the lower glass, and their consequent pressure
against the surface of the upper one. This experiment is
considered by its originator, Mr. H. F. Talbot, to be a satisfactory
argument in favor of the repulsive power of heat.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Heat Passing Through Glass.</h2>


<p>Although glass is a bad conductor it yet allows heat to
pass through it, and the purer the glass the more easy is
this done. Heat a poker red hot, and having opened a
window, apply the poker very near to the outside of the
pane, and the hand to the inside. A strong heat will be
felt at the instant, which will cease as soon as the poker is
withdrawn, and may be again renewed and made to cease
as quickly as before. It is well known that if a piece of
glass be so much warmed as to convey the impression of
heat to the hand, it will retain some part of that heat for
a minute or more; but in this experiment the heat will
vanish in a moment. It will not, therefore, be the heated
pane of glass that we shall feel, but heat which has come
through the glass in a free or radiant state.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Metals Unequally Influenced by Heat.</h2>


<p>All metals do not conduct heat at the same rate as may
be proved by holding in the flame of a candle at the same
time a piece of silver wire and a piece of platina wire,
when the silver wire will become too hot to hold, much
sooner than the platina. Or cut a cone of each wire, tip it
with wax, and place it upon a heated plate (as a fire-shovel),
when the wax will melt at different periods.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Spontaneous Combustion.</h2>


<p>Mix a small quantity of chlorate of potash with spirit of
wine in a strong saucer; add a little sulphuric acid, and an
orange vapor will arise and burst into flame with a loud
crackling sound.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Inequality of Heat in Fire-Irons.</h2>


<p>Place before a fire a set of polished fire-irons, and beside
them a rough, unpolished poker, such as is used in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
kitchen, instead of a bright poker. The polished irons
will remain for a long time without becoming warmer than
the temperature of the room, because the heat radiated
from the fire is all reflected, or thrown off, by the polished
surface of the irons, and none of it is absorbed. The rough
poker will, however, become speedily hot, so as not to be
used without inconvenience. Hence, the polish of fire-irons
is not merely ornamental, but useful.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Expansion of Metal by Heat.</h2>


<p>Provide an iron rod, and fit it exactly into a metal ring;
heat the rod red hot, and it will no longer enter the ring.</p>

<p>Observe an iron gate on a warm day, when it will shut
with difficulty; whereas it will shut loosely and easily on
a cold day.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>The Alchemist’s Ink.</h2>


<p>Dissolve in water a small quantity, about as much as
will lay on a ten-cent piece, of chloride of cobalt, which is
of a bluish-green color, and the solution will be pink; write
with it and the characters will scarcely be visible; but if
gently heated they will appear in brilliant green, which
will disappear as the paper cools.</p>

<p>Dissolve in water a few grains of prussiate of potash;
write with this liquid, which is invisible when dry; wash
over with a dilute solution of iron, made by dissolving a
nail in a little aqua fortis; a blue and legible writing is
immediately apparent.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Chameleon Liquids.</h2>


<p>Put a small portion of the compound called mineral chameleon
into several glasses. Pour upon each water at different
temperatures and the contents of each glass will exhibit
a different shade of color. A very hot solution will
be of a beautiful green color; a cold one a deep purple.</p>

<p>Make a colorless solution of sulphate of copper; add to
it a little ammonia equally colorless, and the mixture will
be of an intense blue color; add to it a little sulphuric
acid, and the blue color will disappear; pour in a little solution
of caustic ammonia, and the blue color will be restored.
Thus may the liquor be changed at pleasure.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>




<h2>Magic Dyes.</h2>


<p>Dissolve indigo in diluted sulphuric acid, and add to it
an equal quantity of solution of carbonate of potash. If a
piece of white cloth be dipped in the mixture it will be
changed to blue; yellow cloth, in the same mixture, may
be changed to green; red to purple; and blue litmus paper
to red.</p>

<p>Nearly fill a wine glass with the juice of beet-root, which
is of a deep red color; add a little lime water and the mixture
will be colorless; dip into it a piece of white cloth,
dry it rapidly, and in a few hours the cloth will become
red.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Wine Changed into Water.</h2>


<p>Mix a little solution of subacetate of lead with port wine;
filter the mixture through blotting-paper, and a colorless
liquid will pass through; to this add a small quantity of
dry salt of tartar; distill in a retort, when a spirit will
arise, which may be inflamed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>The Chemistry of Water.</h2>


<p>More than two-thirds of the earth’s surface is water, so
that in mere quantity alone it is the most important substance
with which we are acquainted. Without it life
would be impossible, for, owing to its quality of dissolving
other bodies, it may be regarded as the great purifier, as
well as the vehicle which brings nourishment to plants and
animals alike.</p>

<p>Not only is water useful, but is among the most beautiful
of Nature’s products. It has carved the valleys between
mountain ranges by its slow dropping for ages, and
has made the fairy glens by rushing down their sides in
torrents. The stately rivers and the roaring oceans are
but forms of its might.</p>

<p>In another state it works out those fantastic grottoes,
mountains and fields of glittering white, that make the
Polar seas the very head center of dreamland.</p>

<p>In still another form it paints the rainbow in the sky,
and hangs like a veil over the landscape, passing from the
most delicate blue over the plain to the deep purple clinging
to distant hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>To it the golden and red hues of sunrise and sunset are
due. The light fleecy clouds that speak the beauty of
spring, and the great thunder stocks that gleam, with
lightning flashes are all composed of water, and water
alone.</p>

<p>It drives our engines and machinery, and speeds our
ships across the sea. Neither is it confined to this earth
alone, for astronomers tell us that vast seas and even
clouds can be seen on the next great planet to the earth,
Mars.</p>

<p>Surely, then, as this wondrous substance is examined,
the ancients can be excused for worshiping the ocean as a
god, and the old alchemists for believing it to be an element.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, water is not a simple substance. It is
composed of two gases, which must be combined before
water is produced. These gases are oxygen and hydrogen.
Every atom of water consists of one part of the former gas
and two parts by volume of the latter. This you may
prove in the following way:</p>

<p>Buy a piece of sodium, a metal that must not be touched
with the fingers, and thrust it into a small one-ounce jar
half full of water; cork the jar tightly.</p>

<p>Through a hole in the cork pass a glass tube, the outer
end being drawn in a flame to a fine point. Apply a light
at the end of the tube. The escaping gas will catch fire
and burn with a light blue flame. This gas is hydrogen.</p>

<p>Next empty the jar and fill with warm water, and place
by means of another cork a small glass jar on to the tube.
Into the lower jar drop a piece of blazing hot platinum.
Repeat this again and again with the same piece of platinum,
being careful not to uncork the upper jar, so that every
time the metal is dropped into the lower jar, you remove
the upper jar with the tube and two corks. After
doing this a dozen times or more take a match that is still
glowing after having been extinguished, and plunge it into
the upper jar. It will burst into flame immediately, and
the gas in the upper jar is oxygen.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Two Bitters Make a Sweet.</h2>


<p>It has been discovered that a mixture of nitrate of silver<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
with hyposulphite of soda, both of which are remarkably
bitter, will produce the sweetest known substance.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Visible and Invisible.</h2>


<p>Write with French chalk on a looking-glass; wipe it
with a handkerchief and the lines will disappear; breathe
on it and they will reappear. This alteration will take
place for a great number of times, and after the lapse of a
considerable period.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>To Form a Liquid from Two Solids.</h2>


<p>Rub together in a mortar a small quantity of sulphate of
soda and acetate of lead, and as they mix they will become
liquid.</p>

<p>Carbonate of ammonia and sulphate of copper, previously
reduced to powder separately, will also, when mixed,
become liquid, and acquire a most splendid blue color.</p>

<p>The greater number of salts have a tendency to assume
regular forms, or become <em>crystallized</em>, when passing from
the fluid to the solid state; and the size and regularity of
the crystals depends in a great measure on the slow or
rapid escape of the fluid in which they were dissolved.</p>

<p>Sugar is a capital example of this property; the ordinary
loaf-sugar being rapidly boiled down, as it is called;
while to make rock-candy, which is nothing but sugar in a
crystallized form, the solution is allowed to evaporate
slowly, and as it cools it forms into those beautiful crystals
termed rock-candy. The threads found in the center of
some of the crystals are merely placed for the purpose of
hastening the formation of the crystals.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Restoration of Color by Water.</h2>


<p>Water being a colorous fluid ought, one would imagine
when mixed with other substances of no decided color, to
produce a colorless compound. Nevertheless, it is to water
only that blue vitriol or sulphate of copper owes its vivid
blueness, as will be plainly evinced by the following simple
experiment. Heat a few crystals of the vitriol in a fire-shovel,
pulverize them, and the powder will be of a dull
and dirty white appearance. Pour a little water upon this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
when a slight hissing noise will be heard, and at the same
moment the blue color will instantly reappear.</p>

<p>Under the microscope the beauty of this experiment will
be increased, for the instant that a drop of water is placed
in contact with the vitriol, the powder may be seen to
shoot into blue prisms. If a crystal of prussiate of potash
be similarly heated its yellow color will vanish, but reappear
on being dropped into water.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Two Liquids Make a Solid.</h2>


<p>Dissolve chloride of lime in water until it will dissolve
no more; measure out an equal quantity of oil of vitriol;
both will be transparent fluids; but if equal quantities of
each be slowly mixed and stirred together, they will become
a solid mass, with the evolution of smoke or fumes.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Two Solids Make a Liquid.</h2>


<p>Rub together in a mortar equal quantities of the crystals
of Glauber salts and nitrate of ammonia, and the two
salts will slowly become a liquid.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A Solid Opaque Mass Makes a Transparent Liquid.</h2>


<p>Take the solid mixture of the solutions of muriate of
lime and carbonate of potash, pour upon it a very little
nitric acid, and the solid opaque mass will be changed to a
transparent liquid.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Two Cold Liquids Make a Hot One.</h2>


<p>Mix four drams of sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) with one
dram of cold water, suddenly, in a cup, and the mixture
will be nearly half as hot again as boiling water.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>To Make Ice.</h2>


<p>Although this trick is performed by means of chemicals,
yet its product is obtained really by the use of mechanical
laws. We must remember that ice is exactly the same
thing as water so far as its composition is concerned, differing
only in its state of density.</p>

<p>Ice, water, and steam differ in density through the
possession of a greater or less quantity of heat. Hence, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
turning of water into ice really is a case of the operation of
mechanical laws.</p>

<p>Now for the experiment. Put into a wide-mouthed jam-jar
a smaller glass vessel containing the water to be frozen.
Around the latter put a mixture of sulphate of soda
(Glauber’s salt) and hydrochloric acid (spirits of salts). The
proportions must be eight parts of the former to five of the
latter.</p>

<p>The action of these two chemicals on one another is to
cause a cold of fifteen to seventeen degrees below zero, or
forty-seven degrees below freezing point.</p>

<p>The same result may be obtained by mixing equal parts
of nitrate of ammonia and water. In winter-time when
the snow is on the ground, <span id="TN_45">with</span> a mixture of one part snow and
one part common table salt an intense cold of twenty degrees
below zero is obtained.</p>

<p>From this last fact we see how stupid are those people
who sprinkle the salt on the pavements to get rid of the
snow. True, the latter melts, but only after the production
of intense cold, which is the cause of many diseases,
not only slight ones like colds and chilblains, but too often
the forerunners of consumption and other lung troubles.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Curious Change of Colors.</h2>


<p>Let there be no other light than a taper in the room;
then put on a pair of dark-green spectacles, and having
closed one eye view the taper with the other. Suddenly remove
the spectacles and the taper will assume a bright red
appearance; but if the spectacles be instantly replaced, the
eye will be unable to distinguish anything for a second or
two. The order of colors will therefore be as follows: green,
red, green, black.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>The Protean Light.</h2>


<p>Soak a cotton wick in a strong solution of salt and
water, dry it, place it in a spirit lamp, and when lit it will
give a bright yellow light for a long time. If you look
through a piece of blue glass at the flame, it will lose all its
yellow light and you will only perceive feeble violet rays.
If before the blue glass you place a pale yellow glass, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
lamp will be absolutely invisible, though a candle may be
distinctly seen through the same glasses.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>To Change the Colors of Flowers.</h2>


<p>Hold over a lighted match a purple columbine or a blue
larkspur, and it will change first to pink and then to
black. The yellow of other flowers held as above will continue
unchanged.</p>

<p>Thus, the purple tint will instantly disappear from a
heart’s-ease, but the yellow will remain; and the yellow of
a wall-flower will continue the same, though the brown
streak will be discharged. If a scarlet, crimson, or maroon
dahlia be tried, the color will change to yellow, a fact
known to gardeners, who by this mode variegate their
growing dahlias.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Changes of the Poppy.</h2>


<p>Some flowers which are red, become blue by merely
bruising them. Thus, if the petals of the common corn-poppy
be rubbed upon white paper, they will stain it purple,
which may be made green by washing it over with a
strong solution of potash in water. Put poppy petals into
very dilute muriatic acid, and the infusion will be of a
florid red color; by adding a little chalk, it will become
the color of port wine; and this tint, by the addition of
potash may be changed to green or yellow.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Changes of the Rose.</h2>


<p>Hold a red rose over the blue flame of a common match
and the color will be discharged wherever the fume
touches the leaves of the flower, so as to render it beautifully
variegated, or entirely white. If it be then dipped
into water, the redness, after a time, will be restored.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Marking Indelibly.</h2>


<p>Write upon linen with permanent ink (which is a
strong solution of nitrate of silver), and the characters
will be scarcely visible; remove the linen to a dark room,
and they will not change; but expose them to a strong
light, and they will be of an indelible black.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>




<h2>Visible Growth.</h2>


<p>Cut a circular piece of card to fit the top of a hyacinth
glass, so as to rest upon the ledge, and exclude the air.
Pierce a hole through the center of the card, and pass
through it a strong thread, having a small piece of wood
tied to one end, which, resting transversely on the card,
prevents it being drawn through. To the other end of the
thread attach an acorn; and having half filled the glass
with water, suspend the acorn at a short distance from
the surface.</p>

<p>The glass must be kept in a warm room, and in a few
days the steam will hang from the acorn in a drop, the
skin will burst, and the root will protrude and thrust itself
in the water, and in a few days more a stem will shoot out
at the other end, and rising upwards, will press against
the card, in which an orifice must be made to allow it to
pass through. From this stem small leaves will soon be
observed to sprout; and in the course of a few weeks you
will have a handsome oak plant, several inches in height.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Colored Flames.</h2>


<p>A variety of rays of light are exhibited by colored
flames, which are not to be seen in white light. Thus pure
hydrogen gas will burn with a blue flame, in which many
of the rays of light are wanting.</p>

<p>The flame of an oil lamp contains most of the rays which
are wanting in the sunlight. Alcohol mixed with water,
when heated or burned, affords a flame with no other rays
but yellow. The following salts, if finely powdered, and
introduced into the exterior flame of a candle, or into the
wick of a spirit lamp, will communicate to the flame their
peculiar colors:</p>


<div class="center">

<p>Or either of the above salts may be mixed with spirit of

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Colored Flame.</span></h3>

<p>Burn spirit of wine on chloride of calcium, a substance
obtained by evaporating muriate of lime to dryness.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Emerald Green Flame.</span></h3>

<p>Burn spirit of wine on a little powdered nitrate of silver.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Instantaneous Flame.</span></h3>

<p>Heat together potassium and sulphur, and they will instantly
burn very vividly.</p>

<p>Heat a little nitre on a fire-shovel, sprinkle on it flour of
sulphur, and it will instantly burn. If iron filings be
thrown upon red hot nitre, they will detonate and burn.</p>

<h2>Water of Different Temperatures in the Same Vessel.</h2>


<p>Of heat and cold, as of wit and madness, it may be said
that “thin partitions do their bounds divide.” Thus,
paint one half of the surface of a tin pot with a mixture of
lamp black and size, and leave the other half or side bright;
fill the vessel with boiling water, and by dipping a thermometer,
or even the finger, into it shortly after, it will be
found to cool much more rapidly upon the blackened than
the bright side of the pot.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Warmth of Different Colors.</h2>


<p>Place upon the surface of snow, as upon the window-sill,
in bright daylight or sunshine, pieces of cloth of the
same size and quality, but of different colors, black, blue,
green, yellow and white; the black cloth will soon melt
the snow beneath it, and sink downwards; next the blue,
and then the green; the yellow but slightly; but the snow
beneath the white cloth will be as firm as at first.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Laughing Gas.</h2>


<p>The above fanciful appellation has been given to nitrous
oxide, from the very agreeable sensations excited by inhaling
it. In its pure state it destroys animal life, but loses
this noxious quality when inhaled, because it becomes
blended with the atmospheric air which it meets in the
lungs. This gas is made by putting three or four drams
of nitrate of ammonia in crystals into a small glass retort,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
which being held over a spirit lamp, the crystals will
melt, and the gas be evolved.</p>

<p>Having thus produced the gas, it is to be passed into a
large bladder having a stop-cock; and when you are desirous
of exhibiting its effects you cause the person who
wishes to experience them to first exhale the atmospheric
air from the lungs, and then quickly placing the cock in
his mouth you turn it, and bid him inhale the gas. Immediately
a sense of extraordinary cheerfulness, fanciful
flights of imagination, an uncontrollable propensity to
laughter, and a consciousness of being capable of great
muscular exertion, supervene. It does not operate in
exactly the same manner on all persons; but in most
cases the sensations are agreeable, and have this important
difference from those produced by wine or spirituous
liquors, that they are not succeeded by any depression of
mind.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Magic Vapor.</h2>


<p>Provide a glass tube about three feet long and half an
inch in diameter; nearly fill it with water, upon the surface
of which pour a little colored ether; then close the
open end of the tube carefully with the palm of the hand,
invert it in a basin of water, and rest the tube against the
wall. The ether will rise through the water to the upper
end of the tube; pour a little hot water over the tube,
and it will soon cause the ether to boil within, and its vapor
may thus be made to drive nearly all of the water out
of the tube into the basin. If, however, you then cool the
tube by pouring cold water over it, the vaporized ether will
again become a liquid, and float upon the water as before.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Gas from the Union of Metals.</h2>


<p>Nearly fill a wine glass with diluted sulphuric acid,
and place in it a wire of silver and another of zinc, taking
care that they do not touch each other, when the zinc will
be changed by the acid, but the silver will remain inert.
But cause the upper ends of the wires to touch each other,
and a stream of gas will issue from them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>




<h2>Green Fire.</h2>


<p>A beautiful green fire may be thus made: Take of
flour of sulphur thirteen parts, nitrate of baryta seventy-seven,
chlorate of potash five, metallic arsenic two, and
charcoal three. Let the nitrate of baryta be well dried and
powdered; then add to it the other ingredients, all finely
pulverized, and exceedingly well mixed and rubbed together.
Place a portion of the composition in a small tin pan,
having a polished reflector fitted to one side, and set light
to it, when a splendid green illumination will be the result.
By adding a little calamine it will burn more slowly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Combustion of Three Metals.</h2>


<p>Mix a grain or two of potassium with an equal quantity
of sodium; add a globule of quicksilver, and the three
metals, when shaken, will take fire and burn vividly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>To Make Paper Apparently Incombustible.</h2>


<p>Take a smooth cylindrical piece of metal, about one
inch and a half in diameter, and eight inches long. Wrap
very closely round it a piece of clean writing paper, then
hold the paper in the flame of a spirit lamp, and it will
not take fire. But it may be held there for a considerable
time without being in the least affected by the flame. If
the paper be strained over a cylinder of wood it is quickly
scorched.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Heat Not to be Estimated by Touch.</h2>


<p>Hold both hands in water which causes the thermometer
to rise to ninety degrees, and when the liquid has become
still, you will be insensible to the heat, and that the
hand is touching anybody. Then remove one hand to water
that causes the thermometer to rise to two hundred
degrees, and the other in water at thirty-two degrees.</p>

<p>After holding the hands thus for some time remove
them, and again immerse them in the water at ninety degrees.
Then you will find warmth in one hand and cold in
the other. To the hand which had been immersed in the
water at thirty-two degrees, the water at ninety degrees
will feel hot; and to the hand which had been immersed
in the water at two hundred degrees, the water at ninety<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
degrees will feel cool. If, therefore, the touch in this case
be trusted, the same water will be judged to be hot and
cold at the same time.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Flame Upon Water.</h2>


<p>Fill a wine glass with cold water, pour lightly upon its
surface a little ether; light it by a slip of paper, and it will
burn for some time.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Rose-colored Flame Upon Water.</h2>


<p>Drop a globule of potassium, about the size of a large
pea, into a small cup nearly full of water containing a drop
or two of strong nitric acid; the moment that the metal
touches the liquid it will float upon its surface, enveloped
with a beautiful rose-colored flame, and entirely dissolve.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Currents in Boiling Water.</h2>


<p>Fill a large glass tube with water, and throw into it a
few particles of bruised amber or shreds of litmus; then
hold the tube by a handle for the purpose, upright in the
flame of a lamp, and as the water becomes warm it will be
seen that currents, carrying with them the pieces of amber
will begin to ascend in the center, and to descend towards
the circumference of the tube. These currents will
soon become rapid in their motions, and continue till the
water boils.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Hot Water Lighter than Cold.</h2>


<p>Pour into a glass tube, about ten inches long and one
inch in diameter, a little water colored with pink or other
dye; then fill it up gradually and carefully with colorless
water, so as not to mix them; apply heat at the bottom of
the tube, and the colored water will ascend and be diffused
throughout the whole.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Expansion of Water by Cold.</h2>


<p>All fluids except water diminish in bulk till they freeze.
Thus, fill a large thermometer tube with water, say of the
temperature of eighty degrees, and then plunge the bulb
into pounded ice and salt, or any other freezing mixture;
the water will go on shrinking in the tube till it has attained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the temperature of about forty degrees, and then,
instead of continuing to contract till it freezes, it will be
seen slowly to expand, and consequently to rise in the tube
until it congeals.</p>

<p>In this case the expansion below forty degrees and above
forty degrees seem to be equal, so that the water will be
of the same bulk at thirty-two degrees as at forty-eight
degrees, that is, at eight degrees above or below forty degrees.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>The Cup of Tantalus.</h2>


<p>This pretty toy may be purchased at any optician’s for
seventy-five cents. It consists of a cup in which is placed
a human standing figure concealing a syphon or bent tube,
with one end longer than the other. This rises in one leg
of the figure to reach the chin, and descends through the
other leg, through the bottom of the cup to a reservoir beneath.
If you pour water in the cup it will rise in the
shorter leg by its upward pressure, driving out the air before
it through the longer leg; and when the cup is filled
above the bend of the syphon, that is, level with the chin
of the figure, the pressure of the water will force it over
into the longer leg of the syphon, and the cup will be emptied,
the toy thus imitating Tantalus, of mythology, who
is represented by the poets as punished in Erebus with an
insatiable thirst, and placed up to the chin in a pool of
water, which, however, flowed away as soon as he attempted
to taste it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>The Magic Whirlpool.</h2>


<p>Fill a glass tumbler with water, throw upon its surface
a few fragments or thin shavings of camphor, and they
will instantly begin to move, and acquire a motion both
progressive and rotary, which will continue for a considerable
time. During these rotations if the water be touched
by any substance which is at all greasy, the floating particles
will quickly dart back, and, as if by a stroke of magic,
be instantly deprived of their motion and vivacity.</p>

<p>In like manner, if thin slices of cork be steeped in sulphuric
ether in a closed bottle for two or three days, and
then placed upon the water, they will rotate for several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
minutes, like the camphor, until the slices of cork, having
discharged all their ether, and become soaked with water,
they will keep at rest.</p>

<p>If the water be made hot the motion of the camphor will
be more rapid than in cold water, but it will cease in proportionately
less time. Thus, provide two glasses, one
containing water at fifty-eight degrees, and the other at
two hundred and ten degrees; place raspings of camphor
upon each at the same time; the camphor in the first glass
will rotate for about five hours, until all but a very minute
portion has evaporated, while the rotation of the camphor
in the hot water will last only nineteen minutes.
About half the camphor will pass off and the remaining
pieces, instead of being dull, white and opaque, will be vitreous
and transparent, and evidently soaked with water.
The gyrations, too, which at first will be very rapid, will
gradually decline in velocity until they become quite sluggish.</p>

<p>The stilling influence of oil upon waves has become proverbial.
The extraordinary manner in which a small quantity
of oil instantly spreads over a very large surface of
troubled water, and the stealthy manner in which even a
rough wind glides over it must have excited the admiration
of all who have witnessed it.</p>

<p>By the same principle a drop of oil may be made to stop
the motion of the camphor, as follows: Throw some camphor,
both in slices and in small particles, upon the surface
of water, and while they are rotating dip a glass rod
into oil of turpentine. Then allow a single drop thereof to
trickle down the inner side of the glass to the surface of
the water. The camphor will instantly dart to the opposite
point of the liquid surface, and cease to rotate.</p>

<p>If a few drops of sulphuric or muriatic acid be let fall
into the water, they will gradually stop the motion of the
camphor, but if camphor be dropped into nitric acid, diluted
with its own bulk of water, it will rotate rapidly for a
few seconds and then stop.</p>

<p>If a piece of the rotating camphor be attentively examined
with a lens, the currents of the water can be well distinguished,
jetting out, chiefly from the corners of the
camphor, and bearing it round with irregular force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The currents, as given out by the camphor, may also be
seen by means of the microscope; a drop or two of pure
water being placed upon a slip of glass, with a particle of
camphor floating upon it. By this means the current may
be detected, and it will be seen that they cause the rotations.</p>

<p>A flat watch-glass may be employed, raised a few inches
and supported on a wire ring, kept steady by thrusting one
end into an upright piece of wood like a retort stand. Then
put the camphor and water in the watch-glass, and place
under the frame a sheet of white paper, so that it may receive
the shadow of the glass, camphor, etc., to be cast by
a steady light, placed above, and somewhat on one side of
the watch-glass.</p>

<p>On observing the shadow, which may be considered a
magnified representation of the object itself, the rotations
and currents can be distinguished.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Fire Under Water.</h2>


<p>Put thirty grains of phosphorus into a bottle which contains
three or four ounces of water. Place the vessel over
a lamp and give it a boiling heat. Balls of fire will soon be
seen to issue from the water after the manner of an artificial
firework, attended with the most beautiful coruscations.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>To Light Steel.</h2>


<p>Make a piece of steel red in the fire, then hold it with a
pair of pincers or tongs; take in the other hand a stick of
brimstone and touch the piece of steel with it. Immediately
after their contact you will see the steel melt and drop
like a liquid.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A Test of Love.</h2>


<p>Put into a phial some sulphuric ether, color it red with
alkanet, then saturate the tincture with spermaceti. This
preparation is solid ten degrees above freezing point, and
melts and boils at twenty degrees. Place the phial which
contains it in a lady’s hand and tell her that if in love, the
solid mass will dissolve. In a few minutes the substance
will become fluid.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>




<h2>An Egg Pushed Into a Wine Bottle.</h2>


<p>To accomplish this seemingly incredible act requires the
following preparation: You must take an egg and soak it
in strong vinegar, and in process of time its shell will become
quite soft so that it may be extended lengthways
without breaking; then insert it into the neck of a small
bottle, and by pouring cold water upon it, it will reassume
its former figure and hardness. This is really a complete
curiosity, and baffles those who are not in the secret to find
out how it is accomplished. If the vinegar used to saturate
the egg is not sufficiently strong to produce the required
softness of shell, add one teaspoonful of strong acetic acid
to every two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. This will render
the egg perfectly flexible, and of easy insertion into the
bottle, which must then be filled with cold water.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A Chemical Fountain.</h2>


<p>Take two small glass jars and close them with corks. In
each of these pierce two holes and introduce a glass tube
curved in the form of a lengthened V. The two extremities
of this tube must not reach further than just a little
below the inner surface of the corks. In one jar pour water
until it is three-quarters full, and pass through the
second hole of the cork a straight glass tube, open at both
ends and reaching nearly the bottom. This jar must be
hermetically corked. (If necessary, seal the top.) In the
other jar put some chalk, and in the second hole of the
cork, left free, pass the extremity of a paper funnel in which
you place a pellet of wax or putty.</p>

<p>Your apparatus thus being ready, through the funnel
pour some vinegar, or better still, some sulphuric acid.
The latter ingredient coming in contact with the chalk,
forms carbonic acid, which, not being able to escape
through the funnel closed by the pellet, passes through the
curved tube into the other jar and is dissolved in the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 515px;">
<img src="images/i_057.jpg" width="515" height="650" alt="" />
</div>

<p>After some time a strong pressure will be exercised on
the liquid, and the water rising rapidly up through the vertical
tube, will spout out as from a fountain.</p>

<p>This experiment may be varied and reduced to a simpler
one. Take one jar, fill it up two-thirds with water, and fit
it with a cork with two holes, through which pass two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
tubes; the one going to the bottom, the other resting just
over the surface of the liquid. The latter should be fitted
with a receiver.</p>

<p>Seal the cork so as to render it air-tight. In the top receiver
pour water, which will go down into the jar and
raise the level of the water already contained in it.</p>

<p>The air, being compressed, will act upon the liquid mass
in the lower jar, and the water will escape through the
free tube in a jet with more or less force according to the
pressure exercised.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Weighing Gases.</h2>


<p>Do not be cast down because you see another term to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
explained. A gas is, you may have already guessed, simply
a fluid. Matter exists in three states, solid, liquid and
gaseous. Everything can exist in these three states under
different conditions of heat and pressure.</p>

<p>For instance, ice, water, and steam are precisely the
same thing, a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, though in
different states. Hence steam is simply the gaseous form<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of ice or water. Now some gases are heavier than air, and
among them is carbonic acid, a gas given off from the lungs
in breathing.</p>

<p>By means of a very simply-constructed balance, you can
prove this gas to be heavier than air. Sounds queer,
doesn’t it? to talk of weighing something that you cannot
handle or see.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to do. Bend some wire, minding that
the beams of the balance are curved as in the figure.</p>

<p>For one side of the scales a strong cardboard box will
answer admirably; for the other the lid of a round box will
serve. Hang the whole on a string and adjust it by putting
some grains of sand in the round scale on which the
weights are placed, to make each side balance one another
and the scales are ready for use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 477px;">
<img src="images/i_058.jpg" width="477" height="650" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The production of carbonic acid is easy. Pour a little
sulphuric acid and water over some chalk. Collect the gas
given off in a bottle or jar. In doing so you need not be
afraid that it will escape, since it is heavier than the air.</p>

<p>In pouring it in the box of the scale, you will see the box
sink down, which is clearly an indication that the gas,
which has just been poured into the scale is heavier than
the air, whose place it has taken. This experiment may
be tried in other curious ways.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>In Water but not Wet.</h2>


<p>With some lycopodium, powder the surface of a large or
small vessel of water; you may then challenge any one to
drop a piece of money into the water, and that you will get
it with the hand without wetting your skin. The lycopodium
adheres to the hand, and prevents its contact with
the water. A little shake of the hand after the feat is over
will dislodge the powder.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Image of a Volcano.</h2>


<p>This is another experiment on the density of liquids. In
a small jar put some wine or colored alcohol, and close it
with a cork, through which you have passed a small tube,
a quill or a hollow straw. In lowering this jar gently in a
pail full of water, you will soon see the liquid escape and
rise to the surface of the water, describing spirals which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
resemble smoke, and give a pretty good image, considerably
diminished, of a volcano.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Reciprocal Images.</h2>


<p>Make two holes in the wainscot of a room, each a foot
high and ten inches wide, and about a foot distant from
each other. Let these apertures be about the height of a
man’s head, and in each of them place a transparent glass
in a frame like a common mirror.</p>

<p>Behind the partition, and directly facing each aperture,
place two mirrors inclosed in the wainscot, in an angle of
forty-five degrees. These mirrors are each to be eighteen
inches square, and all the space between must be inclosed
with pasteboard painted black, and well closed that no
light can enter; let there be also two curtains to cover
them, which you may draw aside at pleasure.</p>

<p>When a person looks into one of these fictitious mirrors,
instead of seeing his own face, he will see the object that
is in front of the other; thus, if two persons stand at the
same time before these mirrors, instead of each seeing
himself, they will reciprocally see each other.</p>

<p>There should be a sconce with a lighted candle placed on
each side of the two glasses in the wainscot, to enlighten
the faces of the persons who look in them, or the experiment
will not have so remarkable an effect.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Imitation of Animal Tints.</h2>


<p>To accomplish this metamorphosis, it is necessary to have
earthen vases which have little edges or rims near their
mouths, and should be of a size sufficiently large to hold
suspended the bird or flower which you intend placing in
them. You should likewise be provided with stoppers of
cork, of a diameter equal to that of their mouths. To make
an experiment upon some bird, it is necessary to commence
by making a hole in the stopper, sufficiently large to contain
the neck of the bird without strangling it. This done,
you divide the diameter of the stopper into two equal parts
so as to facilitate the placing of it around the neck without
doing injury to the bird. The two parts being brought
together, you place at the bottom of the vase an ounce of
quicklime, and beneath that a quarter of an ounce of sal ammoniac.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
When you perceive the effervescence commence
to take place, you promptly insert the stopper, to which
the bird is attached, leaving the neck outside. The plumage
of the body, exposed to this effervescent vapor, will become
impregnated with the various colors produced by this
chemical combination.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Melting a Coin.</h2>


<p>Fix three pins in the table and lay the piece of money upon
them; then place a heap of the flour of sulphur below the
piece of money, and another above it, and set fire to them.
When the flame is extinct, you will find on the upper part
of the piece a thin plate of metal, which has been detached
from it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Explosive Gas.</h2>


<p>Mix two drachms of the filings of iron with one ounce of
concentrated spirit of vitriol in a strong bottle that holds
about a quarter of a pint; stop it close, and in a few moments
shake the bottle; then taking out the cork, put a
lighted candle near its mouth which should be a little inclined,
and you will soon observe an inflammation arise
from the bottle, attended with a loud explosion.</p>

<p>To guard against the danger of the bottle bursting, the
best way would be to bury it in the ground and apply the
light to the mouth by means of a taper fastened to the end
of a long stick.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Cold from Evaporation.</h2>


<p>Ether poured upon a glass tube in a thin stream will
evaporate and cool it to such a degree that water contained
in it may be frozen.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Self-Dancing Egg.</h2>


<p>Fill a quill with quicksilver; seal it at both ends with
good hard wax; then have an egg boiled; take a small
piece of the shell off the small end and thrust in the quill
with the quicksilver; lay it on the ground and it will not
cease tumbling about as long as any heat remains in it; or
if you put quicksilver into a small bladder and blow it up,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
then warm the bladder, it will skip about as long as heat
remains in it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Flash of Fire in a Room.</h2>


<p>Dissolve camphor in spirits of wine and deposit the vessel
containing the solution in a very close room, where the
spirits of wine must be made to evaporate by strong and
speedy boiling. If any one then enters the room with a
lighted candle the air will inflame, while the combustion
will be so sudden and of so short a duration as to occasion
no danger.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Cast Iron Drops.</h2>


<p>Bring a bar of iron to a white heat and then apply to it
a roll of sulphur. The iron will immediately melt and run
into drops.</p>

<p>The experiment should be performed over a basin of
water, in which the drops that fall down will be quenched.
These drops will be found reduced into a sort of cast iron.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Explosion without Heat.</h2>


<p>Take a crystal or two of the nitrate of copper and bruise
them; then moisten them with water and roll them up
quickly in a piece of tinfoil, and in half a minute or little
more, the tinfoil will begin to smoke and soon after take
fire and explode with a slight noise. Unless the crystals
of the nitrate of copper are moistened, no heat will be produced.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Fiery Powder.</h2>


<p>Put three ounces of rock alum and one ounce of honey
or sugar into a new earthen dish, glazed, and which is capable
of standing a strong heat; keep the mixture over the
fire, stirring it continually until it becomes very dry and
hard; then remove it from the fire and pound it to a coarse
powder. Put this powder into a long-necked bottle, leaving
a part of the vessel empty; and having placed it in the
crucible, fill up the crucible with fine sand and surround it
with burning coals. When the bottle has been kept at a
red heat for about seven or eight minutes, and no more vapor
issues from it, remove it from the fire, then stop it with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a piece of cork; and, having suffered it to cool, preserve
the mixture in small bottles, well closed.</p>

<p>If you unclose one of these bottles and let fall a few grains
of this powder on a bit of paper, or any other very dry substance
it will first become blue, then brown, and will at
last burn the paper or other substance on which it has
fallen.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Illumination.</h2>


<p>A very pleasing exhibition may be made, with very little
trouble or expense, in the following manner: Provide
a box, which you can fit up with architectural designs cut
on pasteboard; prick small holes into those parts of the
building where you wish the illuminations to appear, observing
that, in proportion to the perspective, the holes
are to be made smaller, and on the near objects the holes
are to be made larger. Behind these designs thus perforated
you fix a lamp or candle, but in such a manner that
the reflection of the light shall only shine through the hole:
then placing a light of just sufficient brilliancy to show the
design of the buildings before it, and making a hole for
the sight at the front end of the box, you will have a
tolerable representation of illuminated buildings.</p>

<p>The best way of throwing the light in front is to place an
oiled paper before it, which will cast a mellow gleam over
the scenery, and not diminish the effect of the illumination.
This can be very easily planned, both not to obstruct the
sight, nor be seen to disadvantage. The lights behind the
picture should be very strong, and if a magnifying glass
were placed in the sight hole it would tend greatly to increase
the effect. The box must be covered in, leaving an
aperture for the smoke of the lights to pass through.</p>

<p>The above exhibition can only be shown at candle light;
but there is another way, by fixing small pieces of gold on
the building, instead of drilling the holes, which gives
something like the appearance of illumination, but by no
means equal to the foregoing experiment.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;It would be an improvement if paper of various
colors, rendered transparent by oil, were placed between
the lights behind the aperture in the buildings, as they
would then resemble lamps of different colors.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>




<h2>Sun and Spirit.</h2>


<p>Put a small quantity of spirits of wine into a glass, and
put a cent or coin in with it; then direct the rays of the
sun by means of a burning glass upon the coin, and in a
short time it will become so hot as to inflame the spirits.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Stars in Water.</h2>


<p>Put half a drachm of solid phosphorus into a large pint
flask&mdash;holding it slanting that the phosphorus may not
break the glass. Pour upon it a gill and a half of water
and place the whole over a tea-kettle lamp, or any common
tin lamp filled with spirits of wine. Light the wick which
should be almost half an inch from the flask; and as soon
as the water is heated, streams of fire will issue from the
water by starts, resembling sky-rockets; some particles
will adhere to the sides of the glass, representing stars,
and will frequently display brilliant rays. These appearances
will continue at times till the water begins to simmer,
when immediately a curious aurora borealis begins,
and gradually ascends till it collects to a pointed flame;
when it has continued half a minute, blow out the flame
of the lamp and the point that was formed will rush down,
forming beautiful illuminated clouds of fire, rolling over
each other for some time, which, disappearing, a splendid
hemisphere of stars presents itself; after waiting a minute
or two, light the lamp again, and nearly the same phenomenon
will be displayed as from the beginning. Let the
repetition of lighting and blowing out the lamp be made for
three or four times at least, that the stars may be increased.
After the third or fourth time of blowing out the lamp, in a
few minutes after the internal surface of the flask is dry,
many of the stars will shoot with great splendor from side
to side, and some of them will fire off with brilliant rays;
these appearances will continue several minutes. What
remains in the flask will serve for the same experiment several
times, and without adding any more water. Care
should be taken after the operation is over, to lay the flask
and water in a cool, secure place.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Parlor Ballooning.</h2>


<p>It is an interesting and amusing experiment to inflate a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
balloon made of gold-beater’s skin (using a little gum
arabic to close any holes or fissures), filling it from a bladder
or jar, and tying a thread around the mouth of it, to
prevent the escape of the gas. When fully blown, attach
a fanciful car of colored paper, or very thin pasteboard, to
it, and let it float in a large room; it will soon gain the
ceiling, where it will remain for any length of time; if it
be let off in the open air it will soon ascend out of sight.
This experiment may be varied by putting small grains of
shot into the car, in order to ascertain the difference between
the weight of hydrogen gas and atmospheric air.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Marvelous.</h2>


<p>Wrap up a very smooth ball of lead in a piece of paper,
taking care that there be no wrinkles in it, and that it be
everywhere in contact with the ball; if it be held in this
state over the flame of a taper, the lead will be melted
without the paper being burnt. The lead, indeed, when
once fused will not fail in a short time to pierce the paper,
and run through.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Mutability.</h2>


<p>Infuse a few shavings of logwood in common water,
and when the liquid is sufficiently red pour it into a bottle.
Then take three drinking glasses and rinse one of them
with strong vinegar; throw into the second a small quantity
of pounded alum, which will not be observed if the
glass has been washed, and leave the third without any
preparation. If the red liquor in the bottle be poured into
the first glass, it will appear of a straw color; if the second
it will pass gradually from a bluish gray to black,
when stirred with a key or any piece of iron which has
been previously dipped in strong vinegar. In the third
glass the red liquor will assume a violet tint.</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
